Monte Carlo Method in Ising model

### This folder is about classical Ising model with 1/2 spin, up&down.
1. Metropolis-Hastings method
2. Wolff cluster method
3. Calculating autocorrelation time using this: https://dfm.io/posts/autocorr/
4. Measuring error using jack knife.

The data is made from c++ and analyzed (More precisely, 'plotted.') by python.

### Self learning Monte Carlo method on 4-plaquette model: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.041101
5. Check whether plaquette Hamiltonian works well. Also check the cluster update method considering higher order spin correlation
6. Conduct self-learning Monte Carlo method on plaquette Hamiltonian.
7. Calculate autocorrelation time.
