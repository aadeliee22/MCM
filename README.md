Monte Carlo Method in Ising model
* Every results is plotted in `python` folder.  
* For further explanation, read summary.md or `summary.pdf`.

### This folder is about classical Ising model with 1/2 spin, up&down.
1. Metropolis-Hastings method
2. Wolff cluster method
3. Calculating autocorrelation time. (ref: <https://dfm.io/posts/autocorr/>)
4. Measuring error using jack knife method

The data is made from C++ and analyzed by python.

### Self learning Monte Carlo method on 4-plaquette model.   
5. Check whether plaquette Hamiltonian works well. Also check the cluster update method considering higher order spin correlation.
6. Conduct self-learning Monte Carlo method on plaquette Hamiltonian.
7. Calculate autocorrelation time.
