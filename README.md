montecarlo-isingmodel

This folder is about classical ising model with 1/2 spin, up&down.
1. Metropolis-hastings method
2. Cluster-wolff method
3. Calculating autocorrelation time using this: https://dfm.io/posts/autocorr/
4. Measuring error using jack knife.

The data is made from c++ and analyzed (More precisely, 'plotted.') by python.

5, 6. Self learning Monte Carlo method on 4-plaquette model & second nearest neighbor: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.041101
